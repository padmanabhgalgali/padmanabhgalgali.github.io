title: Simplicity Through Convention, The Power of Convention Over Configuration
---

CoC is a design paradigm used in software frameworks that favors adopting default conventions over explicit configuration. 

In other words, the system makes sensible decisions on behalf of the developer, allowing them to focus more on writing unique application code instead of spending time setting up configurations.

Think of it like moving into a pre-furnished apartment. 

You don't have to worry about where the couch or the dining table goes - it's already set up for you. But if you prefer, you can still rearrange the furniture according to your preference. 

Similarly, CoC frameworks come with a basic setup that's ready to go but can be customized as per the developer's specific needs.
